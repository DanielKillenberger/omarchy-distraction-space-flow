# fn-17-marketplace-readiness-and-submission.2 Prepare docs/marketplace-submission.md with the baseline capability mapping

## Description
Write `docs/marketplace-submission.md`: a filled-in copy of the marketplace's submit-plugin issue form (SUBMISSION.md in omacom/omarchy-plugin-marketplace, headings in order: Repository URL, Category, Tags, Suggest a missing tag, Maintainer notes, Submission checklist) for repository https://github.com/DanielKillenberger/omarchy-distraction-space, category Productivity, tags hyprland, workspaces, system (lowercase form for the CLI path), plugin id `io.github.danielkillenberger.distraction-space` (task 1 renames it; assume the new id). Maintainer notes must state plainly: `omarchy plugin add` runs no sudo; privilege arrives only through the explicit `distractions setup` command, which installs the root-owned wrapper at `/usr/local/libexec/omarchy-distraction-space/distractions-nft` and a sudoers drop-in scoped to that one path for the installing user after `visudo -cf`; the wrapper takes `replace ds` or `flush ds` and reads addresses on stdin (say how it validates them, read `distractions-nft`); the notification-service clone under the user's own config; runtime dependencies (nft, sudo, busctl, pactl, python3, optional agent CLIs); Hyprland snippets copied by hand; removal via `distractions setup --remove` then `omarchy plugin remove`; the `manual-setup` label is expected. Below the form add a section "Automated Security Baseline mapping" with one line per documented pattern and capability from the marketplace's SECURITY.md (curl-pipe-shell, cargo-git-unpinned, remote-git-execution-unpinned, sudoers-dangerous-passwordless-command, privileged-process-control-from-shared-temp, installer, package-manager, privilege, remote-build, bundled-executable-binary, service-management, sudoers-modification) saying whether the repo triggers it and pointing at the file that does (install/sudoers.omarchy-distraction-space, ds/setup.py, README.md). Add a "Pinning discipline" section: validation binds to HEAD at filing; main stays frozen until `approved-and-verified`; a needed push is followed by editing the issue; later releases go through the verify form with the new 40-character SHA. Add the `gh issue create` command from SUBMISSION.md with this body. Prose follows the artifact prose contract (no em dashes). Nothing else in the repo changes.

**Touches:** docs/marketplace-submission.md

## Acceptance
- [ ] TBD

## Done summary
Added `docs/marketplace-submission.md`: the submit-plugin issue body (six headings in the marketplace's order, category Productivity, tags hyprland/workspaces/system, maintainer notes on the sudo boundary, the `distractions-nft` argv and stdin validation, the notification-service clone, runtime dependencies, Hyprland snippets by hand, removal, and the expected `manual-setup` label) inside the SUBMISSION.md heredoc plus the `gh issue create` command; an "Automated Security Baseline mapping" section with one line per SECURITY.md finding and capability naming the triggering file and line or the evidence that nothing triggers it; and a "Pinning discipline" section. Nothing else in the repo changed. The maintainer notes describe only what was read in `distractions-nft`, `ds/setup.py`, `ds/net.py`, `ds/state.py`, `ds/listener.py`, `ds/ui.py`, `install/sudoers.omarchy-distraction-space`, `README.md`, and `docs/internals.md`.

Assumes task fn-17.1's id rename to `io.github.danielkillenberger.distraction-space` and the 2.1.0 bump; the document names that id and version, so if task 1 lands differently the "Before filing" bullet and the removal command need the final values.

Gates: `flowctl gate classify` -> TIER_B docs-only; GATE_SKIPPED:unittest:docs-only - cumulative diff classified tier-B (no executable paths touched); `omarchy plugin validate .` rc 0; `qmllint` INCONCLUSIVE (binary not on PATH in this shell, owned by task 1); no lint or format tooling is configured in the repo. Baseline: skipped (docs-only per conductor; no green receipt existed for HEAD).

stage: impl-review - skipped(policy: host-deferred - conductor owns the gate; parallel-wave worker)

### Integration (conductor)

Fast-forwarded onto the spec branch unchanged (69c4a9b). Review (cursor, gpt-5.6-sol-high): round 1 NEEDS_WORK on four wording inaccuracies (config file ownership, flush stdin, the curl inventory, the .flow scan scope), fixed in 445981775efa64314c046d512994f2b06e6e9a9a; round 2 NEEDS_WORK on the scan-scope claim (setup-named .flow task files are scanned whatever their extension), fixed in 6a02d82cc82cf463b806a28adbc3c5ae0daaa13f; round 3 SHIP. Quiesce verification at ea8b4bb15409a4ac0686860ad416d625607a7e7d as in task 1.

stage: wave-dispatch - ran [2 tasks, native worktrees, disjoint Touches, no join collision]
stage: impl-review - ran [round 1 NEEDS_WORK, round 2 NEEDS_WORK, round 3 SHIP] (model: gpt-5.6-sol-high via cursor)
stage: plan-sync - skipped(config: planSync.enabled != true)
