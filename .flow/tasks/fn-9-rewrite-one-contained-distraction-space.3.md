# fn-9-rewrite-one-contained-distraction-space.3 Site block: resolver, nft wrapper with redirect and reject, wrapper install

## Description
Implement `ds/net.py`: `resolve_batch(hosts, generation, reason)` on a `ThreadPoolExecutor(8)` where each worker resolves one host by `subprocess.run(["getent", "ahosts", host], timeout=2)` (the child is killed on expiry; never in-process `getaddrinfo`, which cannot be interrupted) and a 10 s batch deadline that holds because every worker returns within about 2 s (pending hosts fall back to last-good), `shutdown()` that kills tracked children and joins the pool within 3 s, last-good merge in `addrs.json`, `keep_reachable` subtraction, `apply(addresses)` calling `replace`/`flush` via `sudo -n distractions-nft`, `site_block` state on/off/unavailable with one notice, and one log line per batch (generation, reason, host count, resolved and failed counts, stale/coalesced marker, apply result, elapsed ms). The listener (task 7) owns generation bookkeeping and the on-space recheck; this module exposes pure batch functions it can drive. Rewrite `distractions-nft` per fn-8: same `replace|flush ds` interface and address-only stdin, table `inet omarchy_ds` with v4/v6 sets, filter output chain rejecting set members (tcp reset / icmp unreachable), nat output chain redirecting tcp 80 to 28080 and tcp 443 to 28443. Implement all of `ds/setup.py`: content compare, `sudo install -D -m 0755`, sudoers render + `visudo -cf` + `sudo install -m 0440`, refuse user-writable ancestors, `--remove`, then `omarchy-shell shell rescanPlugins` as the last step for both install and remove; a missing or failing rescan leaves files in place, prints the failure, and exits 1. Tests use fake `sudo`, `visudo`, `omarchy-shell`, and `getent` binaries on PATH; the hanging-resolver test uses a fake `getent` that sleeps forever.

**Files:** `ds/net.py`, `distractions-nft`, `ds/setup.py`, `install/sudoers.omarchy-distraction-space`, `tests/test_net.py`, `tests/test_nft.py`, `tests/test_setup.py`.

**Touches:** [ds/net.py, ds/setup.py, distractions-nft, install/**, tests/test_net.py, tests/test_nft.py, tests/test_setup.py]
## Acceptance
- Rendered ruleset contains both redirect rules per family and reject verdicts; empty sets render a table that matches nothing.
- Unresolvable hosts keep last-good; a batch past its 10 s deadline returns with pending hosts on last-good; an empty final set sends `flush`, never an empty `replace`.
- A fake `getent` that sleeps forever: each host returns within about 2 s with last-good, three consecutive batches each finish inside the deadline with no lingering threads or child processes (thread count and children checked after each), and `shutdown()` returns within 3 s while a batch is in flight.
- Every batch writes one log line with generation, reason, counts, apply result, and elapsed ms.
- Wrapper refuses any argv or stdin outside the contract with exit 2.
- Setup is idempotent, refuses a user-writable destination chain, runs the rescan last, and `--remove` reverses it; a denied sudo leaves no partial grant; a failed rescan leaves files installed and exits 1.
## Done summary
`ds/net.py`: `resolve_batch(hosts, generation, reason, keep_reachable=())` on eight workers, each host through a killable `getent ahosts` subprocess with a 2 s timeout, a 10 s batch deadline with pending hosts on last-good, last-good merge in `addrs.json`, `keep_reachable` subtraction from the caller's validated snapshot, batch metadata returned with the addresses and `finish_batch(batch, outcome)` writing one log line for applied, stale, coalesced, or dropped; `apply()` calls `replace`/`flush` through `sudo -n distractions-nft` with `site_block` on/off/unavailable and one notice, an empty final set always flushing; `shutdown()` kills tracked children and joins within 3 s; log I/O failures never propagate. `distractions-nft` renders table `inet omarchy_ds` with v4/v6 sets, the filter reject chain, and the nat redirect chain (80 to 28080, 443 to 28443), refusing any argv or stdin outside `replace|flush ds` with exit 2. `ds/setup.py` installs or refreshes the wrapper and the rendered sudoers line with a compare-or-install inside one privileged invocation per file after `visudo -cf`, refuses user-writable ancestors, runs the plugin rescan last (missing or failing rescan leaves files and exits 1), and `--remove` aborts on a real flush failure so an active table never loses its helper. The `setup` command is real. Implemented by cursor-agent (cursor-grok-4.6-high) in an isolated worktree; the conductor committed and integrated.
